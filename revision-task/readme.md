# 🛠️ Revision Task: GeekRoom AI-ML  
**📅 Deadline:** 20 February  

---

##  **Scenario: GreenLine Automobiles**  

You have recently joined **GreenLine Automobiles**, a growing electric vehicle company, as a **Data Analyst Intern**. The company is about to launch a new line of electric cars and wants to understand how various features of their cars influence the **selling price**.  

Your manager, **Mr. Arjun Verma**, has tasked you with analyzing historical sales data to help the pricing team set competitive prices for the new models.  

---

## **Your Mission:**  
Mr. Verma calls you into his office:  
> "We have a dataset containing information about cars sold over the last few years. It includes details such as engine capacity, fuel type, mileage, and car brand. I need you to analyze this data and build a model that can predict the selling price of a car based on these features."  

---

### **What You Need to Do (in a Single Jupyter Notebook):**  

1. **Explore the Dataset:**  
   - Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover key insights.  
   - Answer questions like:  
     - What are the most common car brands?  
     - Which features are most strongly correlated with the selling price?  
     - Are there any outliers or missing values?  

2. **Preprocess the Data:**  
   - Handle missing values.  
   - Normalize or scale the features if necessary.  
   - Encode categorical variables (like fuel type or brand).  

3. **Apply Linear Regression:**  
   - Build a simple predictive model for car prices using **Linear Regression**.  
   - Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (like **R²** and **RMSE**).  
   - Visualize the predicted vs actual prices.  

4. **Deliver Insights (at the End of the Notebook):**  
   Prepare a short report highlighting:  
   - Key findings from the EDA.  
   - Steps you took for data preprocessing.  
   - Performance of the regression model.  
   - Any recommendations for pricing strategy based on the analysis.

## **Dataset:**  
**[Car Features and Price Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho)**  

---

## **Final Instructions and Expected Outcome**  

Once you've completed your task, your manager, **Mr. Verma**, requests that you submit your work as part of GreenLine Automobiles' internal data science revision exercise.  

### **Step 1: Clone the GitHub Repo**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/phoenix1803/GeekRoom_AI-ML-2025-26-.git
```
### **Step 2: Create Your Folder**
Navigate to the "revision-task" folder:

```bash
cd revision-task
```

### **Step 3: Add the Required File:**
The submission requires a single Jupyter Notebook file (your_name.ipynb), containing:

  - EDA: Detailed exploratory data analysis with visualizations and insights.
  - Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature scaling (if needed).
  - Linear Regression Model: Model training, evaluation, and visualizations of predicted vs actual prices.
  - Summary Section: Key takeaways and recommendations for the pricing strategy.

### **Step 4: Push and Create a Pull Request (PR)**
Once your notebook is ready, push your code and create a PR to the repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Completed the Task"
git push origin master
```

___
Alternative Submission (if PR isn't possible)
If you're unable to send a PR, DM the notebook file to any of the deputies.

Good luck, Analyst! 🚀 GreenLine Automobiles is counting on your insights to revolutionize their pricing strategy!
